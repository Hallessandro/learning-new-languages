Hey guys, in this post I will list 10 short sentences very used in English: 

#### 1. Hey 
I started the post with this, and your use is very simples, use **hey** rather **hi**;

**Example**: Hey Maria, how are you? 

#### 2. Props 
Used when you want to say congratulations for for someone's well-done work. 

**Examples**: You passed the test? Props! 
Props on the awesome new video, man!

#### 3. Whoops 
Same that "Opa" in portuguese. 

#### 4. Alright
There is two differents use for this. The first was the same mean that "mais ou menos" in portuguese. 

The second use is to represent something like "entendi" in portuguese. 

#### 5. Will do
Is the abbreviation for "I will do that" and means that you will do what someone demands to you.

**Examples**: Say hi to your wife for me. --> Alright, will do! 
Oh, and pick up some bread if you're at the grocery store. --> Will do!

> Observation: In portuguese is very common say something like "Manda um abraço/beijo para sua esposa", but in english you just say "say hi..."

#### 6. Shall we?
Is the abbreviation for "Shall we go/leave?" and is an informal way of saying(suggest) that is time to go home. In portuguese is something like "Bora embora". 

#### 7. My bad
Means something like "Sorry" and "Foi mal" in portuguese. 

#### 8. 'Sall good
Is the abbreviation of "It is all good". Can be used as answer for **my bad**. 

#### 9. No prob...
It's another way to say "it is all good" and can be used as answer for **my bad** and **thanks**. 

#### 10. For sure
It's a simple way to say that you agree with something that was said.
